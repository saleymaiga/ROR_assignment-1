================


1- Rails: Create a new Rails application from scratch with one controller that has at least three views. 


2- Ruby: Create an object to model something in the real world. Then, 
   extend the object with another object that is more specific. For example, 
   create an Animal object with attributes that all animals have and then a Bird 
   object that extends animal and has traits specific to birds. Give examples of 
   using each object after they have been declared including assigning attributes
   and using instance methods.
